# Example usage:
#      python run.py ./02parallelLoopEqualChunks.py N
#  Here the N signifies the number of processes to start up in mpi.
#  run.py executes this program within mpirun using
#         the number of processes given.
#
# Exercise:
#    - Compare source code to output.
#    - Run, using these numbers of processes, N: 1, 2, 4, and 8
#    (i.e., vary the last argument to run.py).
#    - Change REPS to 16, save, rerun, varying N again.
#    - Explain how this pattern divides the iterations of the loop
#    among the processes.
