#
# ... illustrates proper ordering of send and receive commands
#     between pairs of processes
#
#  Libby Shoop, Macalester College, July 2019
#
# Example usage:
#      python run.py ./05messagePassing.py N
#  Here the N signifies the number of processes to start up in mpi,
#  which must be positive and an even number.
#
#  run.py executes this program within mpirun using
#         the number of processes given.
#
# Exercise:
#
#    - Run, using N = 4, 6, 8, and 10 processes.
#     - Use source code to trace execution.
#     - Explain what each process:
#     -- sends
#     -- receives
#     -- outputs.
#     - Run using N = 5 processes. What happens?
