#
# ... illustrates deadlock with send and receive commands...

#  Libby Shoop, Macalester College, July 2019
#
# Example usage:
#      python run.py ./04messagePassingDeadlock.py N
#  Here the N signifies the number of processes to start up in mpi,
#  which must be positive and an even number.
#
#  run.py executes this program within mpirun using
#         the number of processes given.
#
# Exercise:
#
#    - run, using more than one process.
#    - Use source code to trace execution.
#    - Why does this fail?
