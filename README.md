# patternlets
Patternlets are minimalist, scalable, working programs that
illustrate parallel design patterns in MPI, OpenMP, Pthreads, etc.

Each patternlet source file resides in its own folder,
which contains a Makefile to build it.

In a Terminal, use the 'cd' command to change directory
to a given patternlet's folder; then enter 'make'
to build that patternlet.

Each patternlet's source file contains a header comment
that describes how to run that patternlet, and also
includes an 'Exercise' that describes what to do with it.

Have fun exploring the world of parallel design patterns!
